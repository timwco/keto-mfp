2. Click [this link](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/account/diary_settings) and scroll to the bottom.

Next, you need to build your own personal URL for this app. Here is the structure.

> https://keto.timw.co?u=[USERNAME]&p=[PROTEIN-GOAL]&f=[FAT-GOAL]


Replace the following with your info (be sure to remove the `[` and `]` around each variable.

* `USERNAME`: Your My Fitness Pal username. Usually displayed at the top of your page.
* `PROTEIN-GOAL`: Your daily protein goal (in grams). Should be whatever you set it to in MFP.
* `FAT-GOAL`: Your daily fat goal (in grams). Shoudl be whatever you set it to in MFP.

_We don't have access to pull this info, so it's why you set it yourself._

Here is an example of what a url might look like.
